Supermarket Management Software

Supermarket Management System is a python application built with some of its prominent libraries such as the Tkinter library (GUI), matplotlib library (Graphs) and mysql connector library (Databases). 

This project is targeted mainly for small supermarkets as these supermarket stores often donâ€™t seem to have the capital for investing on management software. 

The software has various features which can makes it useful in different situations to store the details and records in the supermarket products in centralised databases.

Windows Overview

Home Window it is a seamlessly designed to keep in mind the simplicity while using the software. With all the buttons directly indicating all the features that can be used by the user while using the software.

Add Products Window here the software automatically generates a unique 13 digit number which is used as the product ID while being entered by the user to be stored in the database cutting down on time.

Show Products Window here the software gives the user a clear view on what all products are present in the database by organising the data in the format of a table.

Product Sales it plots a graph of all the products and their respective quantities.

Notification Window here the software gives the user a clear view on what all products need to be ordered soon for a threshold value of 50 units by organising the data in the format of a table.

Settings Window here the software gives the user the option to view all the profiles which access to the software.

Delete Product Window here the software gives the user a the option to delete products which are no longer needed.

Libraries Used:

Matplotlib Library: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter

MysqlConnector: MySQL Connector/Python is implementing the MySQL Client/Server protocol completely in Python. No MySQL libraries are needed, and no compilation is necessary to run it.

Tkinter:Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python.
